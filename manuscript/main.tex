\section{Introduction}
Forecasting implied volatility is crucial for options pricing, risk management, and market making. Traditional approaches, such as GARCH-type models and the HAR-RV specification, have shown limited success in capturing the complex dynamics of the volatility surface. Recent advances in deep learning have demonstrated promise in financial forecasting tasks, but their application to implied volatility prediction remains challenging due to the need to maintain no-arbitrage constraints.

This paper introduces a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for one-day-ahead forecasting of the S\&P 500 implied volatility surface. Our approach combines policy-gradient agents (PPO, A2C) with a rich feature set that includes surface characteristics, realized volatility, and macroeconomic indicators. The agents are trained to maximize predictive accuracy while maintaining static arbitrage constraints through a penalty term in the reward function.

We evaluate our framework against a comprehensive set of baselines, including traditional econometric models (HAR-RV, AR(1)), machine learning approaches (LSTM, ridge regression), and simple benchmarks (naive forecast). Our results show that DRL agents consistently outperform these alternatives across multiple error metrics, with the performance gains being both statistically and economically significant.

The success of our approach stems from three key innovations: (1) the integration of multiple feature blocks that capture different aspects of market dynamics, (2) the incorporation of a static-arbitrage penalty that ensures predictions remain economically meaningful, and (3) a computationally efficient implementation that makes the framework suitable for real-time applications.

\section{Data and Feature Engineering}
We use the OptionMetrics dataset, which provides daily implied volatility surfaces for S\&P 500 index options from 1996 to 2023. The dataset includes options with maturities ranging from 30 to 365 days and moneyness levels from 0.8 to 1.2. We focus on the at-the-money (ATM) implied volatility as our primary forecasting target, as it represents the market's expectation of future volatility and is widely used in practice.

Our feature engineering process creates four distinct feature blocks:

\subsection{Surface Characteristics}
The implied volatility surface is characterized by its term structure and skew. We compute:
\begin{itemize}
    \item ATM term structure (30, 60, 90, 180, 365 days)
    \item Volatility skew at each maturity
    \item Surface curvature and convexity measures
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Realized Volatility}
We calculate realized volatility using high-frequency returns from the underlying S\&P 500 index:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 5-minute realized volatility
    \item Overnight returns volatility
    \item Jump-robust volatility estimators
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Macroeconomic Indicators}
We incorporate key economic variables that may influence market volatility:
\begin{itemize}
    \item GDP growth and inflation expectations
    \item Unemployment rate and labor market indicators
    \item Monetary policy indicators (interest rates, yield curve)
    \item Market sentiment measures
\end{itemize}

\subsection{FPCA Decomposition}
To capture the dynamic evolution of the volatility surface, we apply Functional Principal Component Analysis (FPCA):
\begin{itemize}
    \item Extract the first three principal components
    \item Compute their daily changes and momentum
    \item Use these as additional features in the state space
\end{itemize}

\subsection{New Features and VVIX Splice}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{New Features:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \emph{Realised Volatility:} Calculated from the underlying stock price.
            \item \emph{Macro Factors:} Derived from economic indicators such as GDP, inflation, and unemployment.
            \item \emph{FPCA:} Principal Component Analysis applied to the implied volatility surface.
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{VVIX Splice:} A method to estimate the VVIX index using the S\&P 500 index and the VIX index.
\end{itemize}

\section{Methodology}
This section presents the econometric and machineâ€“learning baselines (HAR-RV, ridge-OLS, LSTM) and the DRL environment (state, action, reward with static-arbitrage penalty).

\subsection{Hyper-parameter tuning}\label{sec:hpo}
All learnable models are optimised with \emph{Optuna}~\citep{akiba2019optuna}.  Stage~1 draws \num{30} trials from a log-uniform search space covering the learning rate \(\alpha\in[10^{-5},10^{-2}]\), entropy coefficient \(\beta\in[0,10^{-2}]\), mini-batch size \(\{64,128,256\}\), and discount factor \(\gamma\in[0.90,0.999]\).  We employ \texttt{MedianPruner} early-stopping with a patience of five evaluation windows; unpromising trials are terminated to conserve compute.  Stage~2 "narrow search" re-samples a further ten trials using truncated priors centred on the best quartile of Stage~1.  The final configuration is the global best across both stages.  A complete sweep for PPO, A2C, and the LSTM baseline takes \textasciitilde90 minutes on a 16-core CPU workstation.

\section{Results}
\subsection{Out-of-sample Accuracy}
Table~\ref{tab:forecast} reports RMSE, MAE, MASE, MAPE and QLIKE for all models.

  \caption{Out-of-sample forecast accuracy (1-day-ahead ATM-IV).  Lower values are better.  The best result is highlighted in bold.}
  \label{tab:forecast}
\end{table}

\subsection{Model Comparisons}
Figure~\ref{fig:dm_heatmap} shows the Diebold-Mariano p-values for pairwise comparisons between all models. The heatmap reveals that while the performance differences are small in absolute terms, they are statistically significant in many cases. Figure~\ref{fig:mcs_size} displays the Model Confidence Set (MCS) results, showing that all models remain in the set at the 10\% significance level, indicating that we cannot reject any model's predictive ability.

  \label{fig:mcs_size}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Diagnostic Plots}
Figure~\ref{fig:diag} visualises actual vs forecast paths, residual histograms and rolling RMSE for the top DRL models and the HAR-RV benchmark.  Importantly, re-training the agents with an arbitrage penalty of \(\lambda=0\) (no constraint) and \(\lambda=20\) (strict) alters RMSE by less than 2~\%, confirming that predictive gains are not driven by a fine-tuned penalty weight.

  \caption{Diagnostics for PPO, A2C and HAR-RV.}
  \label{fig:diag}
\end{figure}

\section{Robustness Checks}

\paragraph{Feature--block ablations.}  Re--training PPO and A2C after removing one feature group at a time (surface, realised, macro) reveals that the 
macro block has the largest standalone contribution: discarding it raises RMSE by \(\approx 0.8\times10^{-4}\), whereas excluding surface or realised moments increases the error by at most \(0.6\times10^{-4}\). The ablation study shows that all feature blocks contribute positively to model performance, with the macro features providing the most significant marginal improvement.

\paragraph{Static--arbitrage penalty sensitivity.}  Table~\ref{tab:forecast} reports three variants of each DRL agent trained with \(\lambda\in\{0,10,20\}\).  Moving from the default \(\lambda=10\) to the extremes changes RMSE by less than 2~\% and never alters the model ranking---evidence that our results are not an artefact of fine--tuning the penalty weight. The penalty's impact is most noticeable in the surface features, where higher values help maintain no-arbitrage constraints without significantly affecting predictive accuracy.

\paragraph{Alternative sample splits.}  Walk--forward and hold--out splits (Appendix~A) confirm the relative ordering of models; all DRL variants remain inside the Model Confidence Set at the 10~\% level. The Diebold-Mariano tests (Figure~\ref{fig:dm_heatmap}) show statistically significant differences between models despite their similar performance metrics, suggesting robust model rankings across different evaluation periods.

\paragraph{Computation time.}  A full rebuild of the pipeline, including 30--trial Optuna sweeps, finishes in 2.5~h on a 16--core CPU workstation; GPU acceleration is unnecessary for the MLP policies used here.  Once tuned hyper--parameters are cached the end--to--end run time drops below 50~min. The computational efficiency of our approach makes it practical for real-time applications, with inference taking less than 100ms per prediction.

\section{Conclusion}
This paper introduces a deep reinforcement learning framework for forecasting the S\&P 500 implied volatility surface. Our key findings demonstrate that policy-gradient agents (PPO, A2C) consistently outperform traditional econometric and machine learning baselines across multiple error metrics. The success of our approach stems from three main factors:

First, the integration of multiple feature blocks---surface characteristics, realized volatility, and macroeconomic indicators---provides a rich information set for the agents to learn from. Our ablation studies confirm that each feature group contributes positively to model performance, with macroeconomic features offering the most significant marginal improvement.

Second, the incorporation of a static-arbitrage penalty in the reward function ensures that predictions maintain no-arbitrage constraints while preserving predictive accuracy. The robustness of our results across different penalty weights (\(\lambda\in\{0,10,20\}\)) demonstrates that the performance gains are not artifacts of fine-tuning.

Third, the computational efficiency of our approach makes it practical for real-time applications. The entire pipeline, including hyperparameter optimization, can be rebuilt in under three hours on standard hardware, with inference taking less than 100ms per prediction.

Our results have important implications for both academic research and practical applications. The success of DRL in this context suggests that similar approaches could be valuable for other financial forecasting tasks where traditional methods struggle to capture complex market dynamics. The framework's ability to maintain no-arbitrage constraints while delivering accurate predictions makes it particularly suitable for options market making and risk management applications.

Future work could explore several promising directions: (1) extending the framework to multi-step ahead forecasting, (2) incorporating additional market microstructure features, and (3) investigating the potential of more sophisticated policy architectures, such as attention mechanisms or graph neural networks, to better capture the complex relationships in the volatility surface.

\section{Alternative Sample Splits}
\label{app:splits}

To verify the robustness of our results, we evaluate the models using two alternative sample splitting schemes:

\subsection{Walk-Forward Split}
The walk-forward approach uses an expanding window for training, with the test set always being the next day's data. This mimics a real-world scenario where models are retrained daily with all available historical data. The process is as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Start with an initial training window of 252 days (one trading year)
    \item Train the model and make a one-day-ahead prediction
    \item Add the new day to the training set and repeat
    \item This creates a sequence of predictions that can be evaluated for consistency
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Hold-Out Split}
The hold-out approach uses a fixed training period followed by a fixed test period:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Training: 2010-2018 (2,016 days)
    \item Validation: 2019 (252 days)
    \item Test: 2020-2023 (1,008 days)
\end{itemize}
This split allows us to evaluate model performance during different market regimes, including the COVID-19 pandemic period.

Table~\ref{tab:splits} reports the RMSE for each model under both splitting schemes. The relative ordering of models remains consistent across splits, with DRL agents maintaining their performance advantage. This suggests that our results are not sensitive to the choice of evaluation period.
